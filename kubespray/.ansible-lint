  # The following rules throw errors.
  # These either still need to be corrected in the repository and the rules re-enabled or documented why they are skipped on purpose.

  - '302'

  - '305'
  - '306'
  - '404'

  # These rules are intentionally skipped:
  #
  # [E204]: "Lines should be no longer than 160 chars"
  # This could be re-enabled with a major rewrite in the future.
  # For now, there's not enough value gain from strictly limiting line length.
  # (Disabled in May 2019)
  - '204'

  # [E701]: "meta/main.yml should contain relevant info"
  # Roles in Kubespray are not intended to be used/imported by Ansible Galaxy.
  # While it can be useful to have these metadata available, they are also available in the existing documentation.
  # (Disabled in May 2019)
